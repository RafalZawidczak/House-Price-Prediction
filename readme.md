The project was based on House Sales in King County, USA data available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction.

In the first section, the data analysis process was performed. Preprocessing was also done, in which some variables were removed, as well as values that were useless or would even interfere with further research.

In the next step, dimensionality reduction was performed using PCA method and then clustering attempt was performed using K-means clustering algorithm.

In the last point, an attempt was made to predict the price values for individual observations using regression algorithms. Finally, the performance of the different algorithms was compared for the prepared dataset.
